### Project Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze the drug reviews using Natural Language Processing. The project will be evaluated using both the accuracy of correct prediction and confusion matrix. There will be predictions for disease like Anxity, Birth Control, Depression, Diabetes, Type 2, etc. The study will be completed in few steps as mentioned below. The first of which we will use the drug review data from drugs.com. This will give an explanation as to how words are extracted can be used to predict the medical condition of a patient. Our group plans to use several types of analyses to help predict the medical condition based on reviews using Bag of words and TFIDF tokenizers and Naive Bayes and Passive Aggressive Classifier. 

### Research Questions:
- Which words/features are more important to a particular medical condition?
- How different tokenization method affect the reviews dataset and accuracy?
- Which model is more efficient for this particular dataset?
- Which is more accurate stemming vs lemmitization?

**This notebook will contain below action items**
- Tokenize the reviews.
- Clean them by removing puntuation, special characters, numbers.
- Convert them to lower case for better accuracy.
- Lemmitization in place of stemming.
- Two different methods to verctorize: Bag of words & TFIDF.
- Apply two most accurate for text dataset machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes & Passive Agressive Classifier.
- Compare both models and choose the most accurate one.
